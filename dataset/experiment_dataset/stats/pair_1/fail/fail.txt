2025-02-10T17:57:05.1828848Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1829715Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1830804Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1831289Z 
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1831650Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1832451Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1832885Z 
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1833139Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1833450Z 
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1833658Z Or undo this operation with:
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1833944Z 
2025-02-10T17:57:05.1834119Z   git switch -

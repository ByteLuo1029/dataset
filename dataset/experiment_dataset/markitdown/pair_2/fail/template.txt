You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
2025-04-13T15:50:13.4248148Z
If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2025-04-13T15:50:13.4250565Z
git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2025-04-13T15:50:13.4251585Z
Or undo this operation with:
2025-04-13T15:50:13.4252510Z
git switch -
2025-04-13T15:50:13.4253225Z
Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

2025-03-27T17:56:52.8696810Z You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8697805Z changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8698858Z state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

2025-03-27T17:56:52.8699775Z If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8700698Z do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8701107Z 
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8701498Z   git switch -c <new-branch-name>
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8702735Z 
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8702907Z Or undo this operation with:
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8703186Z 
2025-03-27T17:56:52.8703327Z   git switch -
